Find out how strongly pstop depends on T
- Change generation of mean and var to include pstop as an extra variable 
- go to new F, go to bunch of Cmaxes with given probabilities + (NEW!) different T-vectors
- For each new Cmax have a bunch of Ts -- as long as for a given F, distribution of new failure doesn't really depend on Cmax -- validate this
- Going to new T-vector has F parameterized in it, but not Cmax -- ok to ignore, don't really care
- Check the above assumption through simulation!!!!!!
- Does Pstop depend no T? -- if no, we can use the previous SACE pstop and assign the distribution according to the current mapping
- Pstop as function of bin number of mu, mean
- come up with g
- make variance binary -- small vs. big -- threshold
- mean -- pstop depends on f -- make that function of mean and variance too -- 
- Leave Cmax as-is maintain superposition model
- start the meeting with the questions we wanted answered
    - Does T depend  on Cmax?
    - Does 
- quantify the non-relationship (or relationship) between CMax and outputs for g function
    - Graph, for certain F, mu input, mu output, how CMax influnces:
        - mean
        - variance
