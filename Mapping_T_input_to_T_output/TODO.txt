Find out how strongly pstop depends on T
- Change generation of mean and var to include pstop as an extra variable 
- go to new F, go to bunch of Cmaxes with given probabilities + (NEW!) different T-vectors
- For each new Cmax have a bunch of Ts -- as long as for a given F, distribution of new failure doesn't really depend on Cmax -- validate this
- Going to new T-vector has F parameterized in it, but not Cmax -- ok to ignore, don't really care
- Check the above assumption through simulation!!!!!!
